I am a Machine Learning engineer at Nissan, passionate about using **computer vision** to contribute to **self-driving technology**. 

In early 2022 while working on a proof-of-concept (POC) for object detection, I got introduced to autonomous vehicles. I also learned how Machine Learning (ML) is used in cars to provide driver assistance features. The field continued to interest me even as the POC ended. I read literature surveys, watched videos and listened to industry leaders on podcasts to understand autonomous driving better.

While improved safety, lesser mishaps due to human error and higher efficiency are its benefits, the increase in accessibility this technology brings is the closest to my heart. 

For millions of Indians who cannot afford to use taxi cars due to cost or age-related constraints (like my grandparents), self-driving vehicles can make convenient travel a reality.
