Cell-cell interactions (CCI) refer to the various ways in which cells within an organism communicate and interact with each other. These interactions are essential for coordinating cellular activities necessary for growth, development, function and survival of an organism. For example, neurons connecting at synapses to transmit nerve impulses is an example of a direct contact CCI. Another example is endocrine signalling, where, cells in specialised glands release hormones into the blood stream that are carried to distant parts of the body.</description></item></channel></rss>
